### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mahmoud Abdelaty, a passionate computer science graduate from the University of Calgary :mortar_board: and an aspiring developer :man_technologist:! I was also previously a head administrator and developer on one of the biggest FACEIT Hubs [MESL](https://www.faceit.com/en/organizers/193c14fd-45e4-404e-bfab-adc9ea6baf9b/Middle%20East%20Stars%20League) :trophy:. I have extensive experience in the esports industry working on many projects from 2020-2022 as a freelancer, and being a data analyst for [YaLLa Esports](https://www.yallaesports.com/). I'm always trying to learn and improve, and using tech to help treat or cure dementia is a dream of mine. ðŸ’«

As an aspiring developer, I've gained experience through various roles, including automation engineer at RBC, data analyst at YaLLa Esports, and head admin at Middle East Stars League (MESL). These experiences have allowed me to hone my skills in areas such as automation, data analysis, community management, and event organization. ðŸ“Š

I'm well-versed in multiple programming languages and technologies, including Python, Java, JavaScript, React, SQL, and more. I'm always eager to learn and expand my knowledge to create innovative solutions. ðŸ’»

Let's work together and make a positive impact! ðŸš€ If you wanna get in touch with me, feel free to shoot me an email :email: or DM me on Twitter :calling:!

constantly dreaming, always learning.
